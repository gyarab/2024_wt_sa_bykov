		<h2>General information</h2>
		<p>
			Trains are great because they offer a reliable, efficient, and eco-friendly mode of transportation, especially for long distances or urban commutes. They can accommodate large numbers of passengers, reducing traffic congestion and lowering carbon emissions compared to cars and planes. Trains also provide a comfortable travel experience with ample space, smooth rides, and the ability to relax or work while en route. Additionally, the ability to travel through scenic landscapes or urban centers while avoiding the stress of driving or airport procedures makes trains an enjoyable and sustainable option for many travelers.
